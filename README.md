# ðŸ“Ÿ â‡’ ðŸ“„ md2pdf

A set of bash scripts to convert Markdown documents to PDF via LaTeX.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to install the 2023 version of
[BasicTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/), along with
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

```bash
brew install --cask basictex && brew install pandoc
```

## Install

Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone git@git.fxdigital.uk:aaronhooper/md2pdf.git
```

## Usage

The main script you will want to use is `./bin/run.sh`.

Put your Markdown files in `./src`, then run the script in the project
root with the following:

```bash
bin/run.sh src/document.md
```

Your freshly pressed PDF will be saved to `dist` and opened in Preview!
ðŸ˜Ž

## Configuration

In `./bin/run.sh`, you can configure `SRC_DIR` to the folder where your
Markdown is located, and `DIST_DIR` to the folder where you want your
PDFs to go, both relative to the directory you will run the command in.

For example, if you wish to run the command in the root of the project
and want your src and dist folders to be located there, then set
`SRC_DIR` to `"./src"` and `DIST_DIR` to `"./dist"` (the default
settings).

### Emoji

If you want to render emoji in your docs, you'll need to install the
`emoji` package from [CTAN](https://ctan.org/) using the `tlmgr` package
manager.

```bash
sudo tlmgr install emoji
```

You'll also need `lualatex` as the PDF engine. Make sure that this is
set in `./bin/build.sh`. Then, add `\usepackage{emoji}` to the
frontmatter of your doc.

```markdown
---
header-includes:
  - \usepackage{emoji}
---
```

To insert an emoji into the document, type `\emoji{name}`. Here is [a
list of
names](https://ctan.math.washington.edu/tex-archive/macros/luatex/latex/emoji/emoji-doc.pdf#page=3)
you can use.

## Gotchas

If you're linking to images using the `![alt text](./images/image.png)`
syntax, the path will be relative to the directory `run.sh` has been run
in, not the src folder. If you are using the defaults, put your images
folder in the root folder outside of `./src`, and run the command there
as well.
